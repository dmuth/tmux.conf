# tmux.conf

These are the .tmux.conf files that I use in my day-to-day work.

## Installation

Clone this repo, then copy these files to $HOME.  Obviously, you'll need rename them to have
a dot in in front of each filename.  e.g. `.tmux.conf` and `.tmux.reset.conf`.


## Usage and Key Changes

These files change up the keys that Tmux uses to accomodate my own workflow.

Here's a summary of what's changed:
- To activate tmux, the control key is now `ctrl-x`
- To split a window or pane horizontally: `ctrl-|` (that's control-pipe)
- To split a window or pane vertically: `ctrl-\` (that's control-backslash)
- To rename the current session: `ctrl-,` (that's control-comma)


I hope folks find this tmux configuration as useful as I do!
